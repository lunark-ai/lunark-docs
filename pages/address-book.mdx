The Address Book feature in Lunark AI simplifies blockchain transactions by allowing users to save and manage frequently used addresses with familiar names. Instead of dealing with long hexadecimal addresses, users can simply refer to their contacts by name.

## Key Features

Managing blockchain addresses becomes effortless:
- Save addresses with custom labels
- Group contacts by purpose or network
- Quick access to frequent recipients
- Automatic address validation
- Transaction history per contact

## Using Address Book

You can easily manage your contacts through natural chat interactions:

```javascript
User: "Add John to my contacts with address 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e"
Lunark: "I've added John to your address book. Would you like to add any notes or specify preferred networks?"

User: "Send 1 ETH to John"
Lunark: "Found John in your address book. Preparing to send 1 ETH to 0x742d..."

User: "Remove Alice from my contacts"
Lunark: "I've removed Alice from your address book. Their transaction history will be preserved for reference."
```

## Managing Contacts in Settings

All your contacts can be accessed and managed through the Settings menu. In the Address Book section, you can:
- View all saved contacts
- Edit contact names and addresses
- Add notes and descriptions
- Set preferred networks per contact
- Manage contact groups
- View detailed transaction history

To access these features, navigate to:
```
Settings > Address Book > Manage Contacts
```

## Security and Validation

Every address added to your address book goes through multiple security checks:
- Address format validation
- Network compatibility verification
- Activity history analysis
- Risk assessment

## Contact Management

```javascript
User: "Show me my contacts"
Lunark: "Here are your saved contacts:
- John (Ethereum)
- Alice (Multiple networks)
- Company Wallet (Polygon)
Would you like to see transaction history for any of them?"

User: "Add new contact Bob"
Lunark: "Please provide the address you'd like to save as Bob"

User: "Edit John's address"
Lunark: "Current address for John: 0x742... Would you like to update it?"
```

## Transaction History

Each contact in your address book maintains a comprehensive transaction history. You can easily track your interaction history, including past transaction amounts, networks used, and typical gas fees. This historical data helps you make informed decisions about future transactions and provides a clear record of your blockchain interactions.

The address book features an intelligent learning system that adapts to your usage patterns over time. It understands your transaction habits, remembers your preferences for different contacts, and can even alert you about unusual activities. This smart functionality makes your blockchain interactions more efficient and secure while maintaining the simplicity of sending to a familiar name rather than a complex address.

```javascript
User: "Send the usual amount to John"
Lunark: "I see you typically send 0.5 ETH to John. Would you like me to prepare that transaction? [Execute Transfer]"

User: "Send USDT to Alice"
Lunark: "I notice you usually interact with Alice on Polygon network, but you're currently on Ethereum. Would you like to switch networks? [Switch to Polygon]"
```
