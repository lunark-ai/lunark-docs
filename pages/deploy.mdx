The Smart Contract Deployment feature will simplify the process of deploying and managing smart contracts across different blockchain networks. This feature is designed to make smart contract deployment accessible to users of all technical levels.

## Planned Features

- One-click deployments
- Contract templates
- Multi-chain support
- Contract verification
- Security auditing
- Gas optimization
- Contract management dashboard

Lunark AI simplifies smart contract deployment by handling the technical complexities while maintaining security and control. Through natural language interaction, users can deploy contracts, understand their functionality, and manage their parameters without dealing with complex code directly.

## Smart Contract Creation

Our platform guides you through the contract creation process, helping you understand each component and parameter. Whether you're deploying a standard token contract or a custom DeFi protocol, Lunark AI ensures you understand the implications of each decision.

Deploy Token Contract Example:

```javascript
User: "Create a new ERC20 token"
Lunark: "I'll help you create an ERC20 token. I need some details:
- Token name
- Symbol
- Initial supply
- Features (mintable, burnable, pausable)

Would you like to start with these parameters?"
```

```javascript
User: "Yes, name: Lunark Token, symbol: LRK, supply: 1000000"
Lunark: "I've prepared your token contract with:
- Name: Lunark Token
- Symbol: LRK
- Initial Supply: 1,000,000 LRK
- Standard security features included

[Review Contract] [Deploy Now]"
```
## Security Verification

Before deployment, every smart contract undergoes comprehensive security checks. Our system performs thorough code analysis for vulnerabilities, reviews gas optimization possibilities, verifies contract logic, and tests for common attack vectors. This process ensures your contract follows security best practices and is optimized for efficient operation.

## Contract Management

After deployment, Lunark AI helps you manage your smart contracts through natural language commands. Monitor contract performance, interact with contract functions, and make necessary adjustments with simple conversations.

Contract Management Examples:

```javascript
User: "Check my token contract status"
Lunark: "Your Lunark Token (LRK) contract:
- Total Supply: 1,000,000 LRK
- Holders: 28
- Transactions: 145
- Last interaction: 2 hours ago
```

What would you like to know more about?"

```javascript
User: "Add minting capability"
Lunark: "I'll help you add a minting function to your contract:
1. Deploy new implementation
2. Update proxy contract
3. Verify on explorer

Estimated gas: 0.05 ETH
[Review Changes] [Execute Update]"
```

## Supported Standards

Lunark AI supports deployment of various smart contract types through our built-in templates. From standard ERC20 tokens and ERC721 NFTs to complex DeFi protocols and governance systems, our platform provides secure, tested templates for your specific needs. Each template can be customized to meet your requirements while maintaining security and efficiency.

Advanced Contract Interactions:

```javascript
User: "Set up vesting for team tokens"
Lunark: "Creating vesting schedule for team tokens:
- Amount: 100,000 LRK
- Cliff: 6 months
- Vesting: 24 months linear
- Beneficiaries: 5 addresses

[Review Schedule] [Deploy Vesting Contract]"
```

```javascript
User: "Update token parameters"
Lunark: "Current modifiable parameters:
- Transfer limits
- Pause/Unpause
- Access controls
What would you like to modify?"
```
