The Bridge feature will enable seamless asset transfers between different blockchain networks. This cross-chain bridge solution is designed to be secure, efficient, and user-friendly.

## Planned Features

- Cross-chain asset transfers
- Multiple network support
- Optimized gas fees
- Transaction tracking
- Bridge history
- Security monitoring

Lunark AI simplifies cross-chain asset transfers by automatically finding and executing the most efficient bridging solutions. Through natural language commands, users can move their assets across different blockchain networks without dealing with the complexity of traditional bridge protocols.

## How It Works

When you initiate a bridge transfer, Lunark AI analyzes multiple factors to provide the best bridging solution. The system evaluates transaction costs, processing times, and security considerations across various bridge protocols to find the optimal path for your assets.

Basic bridge transfer:

```javascript
User: "Bridge 1000 USDT from Ethereum to Polygon"
Lunark: "I've found the best bridging option:

Protocol: Polygon Bridge
Fee: $12.50 (gas + bridge fee)
Estimated time: ~15 minutes
Security rating: High

[Execute Bridge]"
```

Complex bridge analysis:

```javascript
User: "What's the best way to send USDT to Arbitrum?"
Lunark: "I've analyzed multiple bridge options:

1. Official Arbitrum Bridge
  - Fee: $15.20
  - Time: 15-20 mins
  - Security: Highest

2. LayerZero
  - Fee: $12.80
  - Time: 5-10 mins
  - Security: High

[Use Official Bridge] [Use LayerZero]"
```

## Smart Bridge Selection

Our system automatically selects the most efficient bridge for your transfer by evaluating multiple factors simultaneously. It considers current network conditions, bridge liquidity, transfer fees, and processing times to find the optimal route. The system also monitors the transaction throughout its journey, providing real-time updates on its progress.

Bridge status tracking:

```javascript
User: "Check my bridge status"
Lunark: "Your 1000 USDT bridge to Polygon:
- Step 1/3: Transaction confirmed on Ethereum ‚úÖ
- Step 2/3: Waiting for block confirmations ‚è≥
- Step 3/3: Pending on Polygon
Estimated completion: 8 minutes"
```

Network gas optimization:

```javascript
User: "Bridge ETH to Arbitrum"
Lunark: "Ethereum gas is currently high ($25). Would you like to:
1. Proceed now
2. Wait for lower gas (alert when < $15)
3. Try alternative route via Optimism
Choose your preference."
```

## Security First

Every bridge transaction goes through comprehensive security checks. The system continually monitors bridge protocols for their security status and liquidity levels. You'll receive clear information about the selected bridge's security features and historical performance before confirming your transfer.

## Supported Networks

Lunark AI supports bridging between major blockchain networks:
- Ethereum
- Polygon
- BSC
- Arbitrum
- Optimism
- Base
- And more to come

Advanced bridging:

```javascript
User: "Send 5000 USDT to Arbitrum cheapest way"
Lunark: "I suggest this optimized route:
1. Bridge to Polygon first (fee: $0.50)
2. Then bridge to Arbitrum (fee: $5)
Total fees: $5.50 vs Direct: $25
Would you like me to prepare this route?

[Execute Optimized Route] [Bridge Directly]"
```

Multi-token bridging:

```javascript
User: "Bridge my stables to Polygon"
Lunark: "Found these tokens in your wallet:
- 1000 USDT
- 500 USDC
- 200 DAI
I can bridge all in a single transaction to save gas.
Total fee: $15 (vs $45 separately)
[Bridge All] [Choose Tokens]"
```
