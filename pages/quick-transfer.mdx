Quick Transfer simplifies the process of sending cryptocurrencies across blockchain networks. With natural language commands and smart optimizations, transferring assets becomes as simple as sending a message.

## How It Works

When you initiate a transfer, Lunark AI automatically:
- Validates the recipient address
- Checks network status
- Optimizes gas fees
- Ensures transaction security
- Presents a clear summary

Simple Transfer:

```javascript
User: "Send 1 ETH to John"
Lunark: "I've prepared a transaction to send 1 ETH to John:
- Current gas fee: $2.50
- Estimated time: < 1 minute
[Execute Transfer]"
```

Using Default Settings:

```javascript
User: "Send the usual amount to Alice"
Lunark: "I see you typically send 100 USDT to Alice. I've prepared the transaction with your preferred settings. [Execute Transfer]"
```

## Smart Features

The Quick Transfer system learns from your transaction patterns to provide a more personalized experience. It remembers your preferred settings, frequently used amounts, and common recipients to streamline future transactions.

## Network Detection

Lunark AI automatically detects your current network and the optimal network for your transaction. If a network switch is needed, you'll be presented with a simple option to change networks before proceeding with your transfer.

Network Detection Example:

```javascript
User: "Send 100 USDT to Bob"
Lunark: "I notice you're on Ethereum network where gas fees are high ($15). The same transaction on Polygon would cost about $0.50. Would you like to:
[Continue on Ethereum] [Switch to Polygon]"
```

Multi-Network Contact:

```javascript
User: "Send 500 USDT to Company Wallet"
Lunark: "I see this address exists on multiple networks. Which would you prefer:
- Ethereum (Gas: $12)
- Polygon (Gas: $0.30)
- BSC (Gas: $0.20)"
```

## Transaction Review

Before executing any transfer, you'll see a clear summary of your transaction including:
- Amount and token
- Recipient details
- Network information
- Gas fees
- Expected completion time

Advanced Transfer Options:

```javascript
User: "Transfer 1000 USDT to John with low gas"
Lunark: "I'll monitor gas prices and execute when they're below 20 gwei. Current gas is 35 gwei. I'll notify you once the transfer is completed."
```

Cross-Chain Transfer:

```javascript
User: "Send 100 USDT from Ethereum to Polygon"
Lunark: "I'll help you bridge 100 USDT to Polygon:
- Bridge fee: $2.00
- Estimated time: 15 minutes
[Start Bridge Transfer]"
```
