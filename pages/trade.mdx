Lunark AI revolutionizes cryptocurrency trading by integrating both decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges (CEX) into a unified trading interface. Through natural language commands, users can execute trades across multiple platforms while Lunark AI finds the best execution opportunities.

## Decentralized Trading (DEX)

Our DEX integration enables seamless trading across major decentralized exchanges and protocols. The system automatically aggregates liquidity across multiple DEX protocols to ensure the best possible execution. By analyzing various factors such as available liquidity, price impact, and gas costs, Lunark AI determines the optimal trading routes and execution strategies for your trades.

DEX Trading Examples:

```javascript
User: "Buy 1 ETH at best price"
Lunark: "I've analyzed DEX liquidity pools:

Best route found via Uniswap V3:
1 ETH = 2,350 USDT
Price impact: 0.05%
Gas fee: $12.50

[Execute Trade] [Show More Routes]"
```

```javascript
User: "Set a limit order for ETH at 2300 USDT"
Lunark: "I'll monitor DEX prices and execute when ETH reaches 2300 USDT. Currently tracking prices across Uniswap, Curve, and other protocols."
```

## Centralized Trading (CEX)

Through secure API integrations, Lunark AI connects with major centralized exchanges to provide comprehensive trading capabilities. Users can execute spot trades, monitor real-time order books, and track their portfolio performance across multiple exchanges. The system maintains secure connections with each exchange while providing a unified interface for all your trading needs.

CEX Trading Examples:

```javascript
User: "Buy ETH on Binance"
Lunark: "Current prices on Binance:
ETH/USDT: 2,348
Available balance: 5,000 USDT
Order types: Market/Limit/Stop

How would you like to proceed with your purchase?"
```

```javascript
User: "Place a stop-loss for ETH at 2200"
Lunark: "Stop-loss order prepared on Binance:
Pair: ETH/USDT
Stop Price: 2,200
Quantity: 1 ETH
[Place Order]"
```

## Unified Trading Experience

Whether you're trading on DEXs or CEXs, Lunark AI provides a consistent experience. Simply express your trading intention, and the system will analyze both decentralized and centralized options to find the best execution venue. This unified approach ensures you always get the best available prices and execution quality, regardless of where the liquidity exists.

## Supported Platforms

Our decentralized exchange integration includes major protocols such as Uniswap V2 & V3, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, Curve Finance, Balancer, and dYdX. On the centralized exchange front, we support leading platforms including Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, OKX, Bybit, with more integrations planned for the future.

Unified Trading Examples:

DEX Prices:
- Uniswap V3: 2,350 USDT
- Curve: 2,348 USDT
